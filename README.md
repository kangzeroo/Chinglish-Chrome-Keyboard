https://chinglish-keyboard.firebaseapp.com/

## TO RUN
Visit chrome://extensions and make sure you are in developer mode. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the `/chrome_extension` folder where our chrome extension lives. Now try out the addon!

## TO DO
- Convert from ReactJS to Chrome Extension (may need to play around with key event listeners and override input values)
- You will want to still use `react-react-app`. Just follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@gilfink/building-a-chrome-extension-using-react-c5bfe45aaf36)
